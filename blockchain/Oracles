The oracle network provided by the chainlink gives us the way to load real world data into the blockchain as blockchain nodes are isolated and do not interact with 
real world directly


The oracle network is itlself a decentralised network, which loads off-chain real world data, and periodically updates the data on the blockchain networks,
be it mainnet, testnets like sepolia, meaning that the oracles periodically create new transactions which update these contracts deployed on various chains,

so when you go to their documentation, you can see you get different contract addresses for same contract on different chains.

So, you simply get the interface in your solidity code, implement it using this address, removing the need for ABI, and simply call functions in this contract and get 
updated info.
