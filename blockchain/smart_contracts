Confusion: How does state of contract is maintained?


Normally, when you run a simple program in suppose python, it runs and works with instantaneous variables at that moment and uses the default values available at that 
moment

But, here in contract, when you call a function which changes the value of suppose a variable, next time you get the value of variable, it is updated one,

So, does EVM change the contract and update the variable and redeploy it?

Well, the architecture and workflow of EVM is kinda complicated, and exactly how does it work, is under black box :)
