*****Primary Key:

Definition: A primary key is a minimal set of attributes (columns) that uniquely identifies each record in a table.
It is a special type of candidate key chosen to uniquely identify records and enforce entity integrity.

Functional Dependency Perspective: In terms of functional dependencies, the primary key is a super key that has the additional property 
of being irreducible. It means that no proper subset of the primary key can uniquely identify the records.


*****Candidate Key:

Definition: A candidate key is a set of attributes that can uniquely identify each record in a table. 
It is a minimal super key, meaning that no proper subset of the candidate key can uniquely identify the records.

Functional Dependency Perspective: From a functional dependency viewpoint, a candidate key is a super key that does not have any redundant attributes.
It means that all attributes in the candidate key are necessary to determine the other attributes in the table.


*****Super Key:

Definition: A super key is a set of attributes that can uniquely identify each record in a table. 
It may contain additional attributes that are not strictly necessary for uniqueness.

Functional Dependency Perspective: In the context of functional dependencies, a super key is a set of attributes that can
determine all the attributes in a table. It can include redundant or unnecessary attributes, i.e., 
attributes that are not required to determine the other attributes.





Here, you can understand like this,

Super keys are just any combition of attributes be it single or multiple that just unique identify the tuple in the table,they may have redudant 
attributes in them which need not to be there in order to determine other attributes i.e proper subset of it can also determine unique tuple in the
table

while Candidate keys are those Super keys of which no proper subset can uniquely identify the tuple in the table, i.e they don't have any redudant
attributes, all attributes in those keys are essential to determine the other attributes.


While Primary key is one of chosen Candidate key, it can be any Candidate key, as every Candidate key has Potential to be a Primary key,
but such a Candidate key is chosen which is minimal or having minimal attributes, while this is not a strict rule.
