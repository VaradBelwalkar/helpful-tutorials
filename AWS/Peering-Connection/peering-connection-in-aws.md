## Setup Process

1. **Requester and Accepter Roles:**
   - The requester initiates the connection.

   - Specify if the accepter is in the same account and region.
   - Provide the accepter's account ID and region if different.
   - Enter the accepter VPC ID.

## Connection Management

- For same-account connections, go to the Peering Connection dashboard and accept the connection.
- For different-account connections, the accepter manages the connection in their account.

## Additional Steps

- After creating the connection, update route tables in both VPCs to ensure seamless traffic flow.
- Specify the destination network and designate the Peering Connection as the gateway in route table configurations.

## Conclusion

AWS Peering Connection streamlines VPC networking, allowing for efficient communication between VPCs in various scenarios.
