### Transit-Gateway is NOT free.

Transit gateway is the solution for multiple VPCs to connect to each other.
As you know that with one Peering-Connection, you can only connect Two VPCs to each other, and only VPCs, nothing else.
that is why it is free to use.

But with the Transit Gateway, you can not only connect multiple VPCs together, but also VPCs direct connect, to VPNs as well

So you can have the whole virtual network infrastructure there where you have multiple VPCs, your datacenters, as well as VPNs all connected
to each other.
Hence it is not free.
