CSRF prevention:

Here server stores the CSRF token in the hidden field of the form (any form which is sensitive) and also stores the CSRF as cookie

Here server transfers this CSRF as cookie in the response, 


When user submits the form, the server authenticates the CSRF in the form submitted against the CSRF token in the cookie sent,
If both are same, server accepts the form else reject it
