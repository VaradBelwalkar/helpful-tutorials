JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) are usually passed in the Authorization header of an HTTP request. 
The Authorization header is used to send authentication information to the server, and JWTs are a common way to authenticate requests.

It is also possible to pass a JWT in the body of a request, although this is not as common. 

To do this, you can include the JWT in the request body as a string and set the Content-Type header to "application/jwt". 
However, keep in mind that most servers expect JWTs to be passed in the Authorization header and may not support passing them in the body.
