if encoded, err := cookieHandler.Encode("session", value); err == nil {
		cookie := &http.Cookie{
			Name:  "session",
			Value: encoded,
			Path:  "/",
		}
		http.SetCookie(response, cookie)
	}"
  
  
  
  
  
  the Path field in the http.Cookie struct is being set to the value "/". This field is used to specify the path for which the cookie is valid.

When a client makes a request to a web server, the browser will send any cookies that have been set for the domain of the request,
and whose path match the request path. By setting the Path to "/", it means that the cookie will be sent for all requests to the domain,
regardless of the specific path of the request.

This is useful for when the website uses different paths for different pages, but the cookie should be sent with all requests.
For example, if your website has a login page at the path "/login", and a dashboard page at the path "/dashboard", 
you would want to set the path to "/" so that the cookie is sent with requests to both "/login" and "/dashboard".
