Install sosumi snap package in GNU linux to install macOS on qemu VM

Follow the steps, and you can refer online youtube videos to fully install the OS

Sosumi works perfectly on my machine (Ryzen 5600h)

The only problem with this is some of the apps from app store aren't available for catalina :(

To install later versions of macOS especially ventura, you might need to visit: https://github.com/kholia/OSX-KVM

I haven't personally tried yet, but surely update here if it works successfully on my machine. :)
