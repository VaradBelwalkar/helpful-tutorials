The MongoDB shell provides the following methods to update documents in a collection:

        To update a single document, use db.collection.updateOne().

        To update multiple documents, use db.collection.updateMany().

        To replace a document, use db.collection.replaceOne().



To update the first document in the sample_mflix.movies collection where title equals "Twilight":

        use sample_mflix
        db.movies.updateOne( { title: "Twilight" },
        {
          $set: {
            plot: "A teenage girl risks everything–including her life–when she falls in love with a vampire."
          },
          $currentDate: { lastUpdated: true }
        })

      The update operation:

    Uses the $set operator to update the value of the plot field for the movie Twilight.

    Uses the $currentDate operator to update the value of the lastUpdated field to the current date. If lastUpdated field does not exist, $currentDate will create the field.




To update all documents in the sample_airbnb.listingsAndReviews collection to update where security_deposit is less than 100:

        use sample_airbnb
        db.listingsAndReviews.updateMany(
          { security_deposit: { $lt: 100 } },
          {
            $set: { security_deposit: 100, minimum_nights: 1 }
          }
        )



To replace the first document from the sample_analytics.accounts collection where account_id: 371138:

        db.accounts.replaceOne(
          { account_id: 371138 },
          { account_id: 893421, limit: 5000, products: [ "Investment", "Brokerage" ] }
        )


        Here understand that second argument is entire document to replace with the original one.
