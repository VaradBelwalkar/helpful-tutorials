The MongoDB shell provides the following methods to delete documents from a collection:

        To delete multiple documents, use db.collection.deleteMany().

        To delete a single document, use db.collection.deleteOne().

To delete all documents from the sample_mflix.movies collection:

        use sample_mflix
        db.movies.deleteMany({})    // Here you give empty filter, means catch all filter


To delete all documents from the sample_mflix.movies collection where the title equals "Titanic":

        use sample_mflix
        db.movies.deleteMany( { title: "Titanic" } )


To delete the first document from the sample_mflix.movies collection where the cast array contains "Brad Pitt":

        use sample_mflix
        db.movies.deleteOne( { cast: "Brad Pitt" } )
