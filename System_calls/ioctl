The ioctl() function, short for "input-output control," is a system call available in Unix-like operating systems, including Linux. 
It is a versatile and generic interface used to control and configure various characteristics of devices, including terminals, files, sockets,
and other special devices.

The ioctl() function allows applications to send control commands to a device driver or underlying subsystem, providing a means to
manipulate and query device-specific settings or behaviors. It serves as a mechanism for interacting with devices beyond the basic 
read and write operations.

The ioctl() function has the following syntax:

########################################################
int ioctl(int fd, unsigned long request, ...);
########################################################

fd: The file descriptor associated with the device or object on which the operation is to be performed.
request: An unsigned long value that specifies the specific operation or control command to be executed.
...: Optional additional arguments that depend on the specific request being made.
The ioctl() function takes a file descriptor (fd) that represents the device or object on which the control operation is to be performed. 
The request argument is an unsigned long value that identifies the specific control command to be executed. 
The interpretation of the request value is specific to the device or subsystem being accessed.

The optional additional arguments (...) are used to pass or receive data associated with the control command. 
The exact structure and content of these arguments depend on the specific request being made. It is common to pass pointers to data 
structures as arguments to provide input or retrieve output from the control operation.

The return value of ioctl() is an integer that indicates the success or failure of the operation. A value of -1 indicates an error, 
and the specific error code can be obtained by examining the errno variable.
