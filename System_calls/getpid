The getpid() function is a system call in Unix-like operating systems (including Linux) that is used to retrieve the process ID (PID)
of the current running process. The PID is a unique identifier assigned to each process by the operating system.

The getpid() function does not take any arguments and returns an integer value, which represents the PID of the calling process. 
Here's a brief explanation of how it works:

When you call the getpid() function in your program, the system call is made to the operating system kernel.
The kernel, being responsible for process management, has a data structure called the "process control block" (PCB) for each process. 
The PCB contains various pieces of information about the process, including its PID.
The kernel retrieves the PCB of the current process and extracts the PID value from it.

Finally, the kernel returns the PID value to the calling program, and it can be stored in a variable or used for further processing.
Here's a simple example to demonstrate the usage of getpid() in a C program:

#########################################################################################
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main() {
    pid_t pid = getpid();  // Call getpid() to retrieve the process ID

    printf("The process ID is: %d\n", pid);

    return 0;
}
#########################################################################################


In this example, the getpid() function is called within the main() function to obtain the PID of the current process. 
The retrieved PID is then printed using printf().
