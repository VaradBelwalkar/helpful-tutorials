To send the publickey to the key-server:
          gpg --keyserver <keyserverurl> --send-keys <fingerprint>
          
For example:
          gpg --keyserver hkps://keys.openpgp.org --send-keys <fingerprint>
          
          
Now to search for a key on keyserver: (NOTE: Reflection of uploaded publickey takes some time)
          gpg --keyserver hkps://keys.openpgp.org --search-keys <username or email>
          
Once you find the key on the keyserver, along with the metadata, it will also show the fingerprint for that key,
So to download that public key:
          gpg --keyserver hkps://keys.openpgp.org --recv-keys <fingerprint>

Also other than openpgp,

we have pgp.mit.edu keyserver available
so you can change above url to,
                    hkp://pgp.mit.edu
