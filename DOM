The DOM is a representation of the structure of an HTML document, and it is created by the browser when it parses the HTML code.
It consists of a tree-like structure of objects, where each object represents an element in the HTML document (e.g., a div, a p, etc.).

Here is an example of what the DOM object might look like for the following HTML document:


<html>
  <head>
    <title>My Page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="myDiv">
      <p>Hello, world!</p>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>



//This is actual document object (just representation, as it also contains other various fields and methods)
{
  nodeType: 9,
  nodeName: "HTML",
  childNodes: [
    {
      nodeType: 1,
      nodeName: "HTML",
      childNodes: [
        {
          nodeType: 1,
          nodeName: "HEAD",
          childNodes: [
            {
              nodeType: 1,
              nodeName: "TITLE",
              childNodes: [
                {
                  nodeType: 3,
                  nodeName: "#text",
                  nodeValue: "My Page"
                }
              ]
            }
          ]
        },
        {
          nodeType: 1,
          nodeName: "BODY",
          childNodes: [
            {
              nodeType: 1,
              nodeName: "DIV",
              attributes: [
                {
                  name: "id",
                  value: "myDiv"
                }
              ],
              childNodes: [
                {
                  nodeType: 1,
                  nodeName: "P",
                  childNodes: [
                    {
                      nodeType: 3,
                      nodeName: "#text",
                      nodeValue: "Hello, world!"
                    }
                  ]
                }
              ]
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
As you can see, the DOM object is a nested structure of objects, with each object representing an element in the HTML document. 
The object has properties such as nodeType, nodeName, and nodeValue that represent the type of node, the name of the node,
and the value of the node, respectively. It also has a childNodes property that contains an array of child nodes, 
and an attributes property that contains an array of attribute objects.
