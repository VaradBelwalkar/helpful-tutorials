In decision trees,

we have to find whether the split is pure or impure,

To check it, we either use entropy or gini impurity, and find out whether our split is impure or not, 
and this info is used to find whether to further split the node into multiple based on some other feature.



To find starting Root Node/feature or next best node/feature to start with,
We need to calculate information gain,which tells us that how much information we can gain from that feature, and of course,
the maximum one will take first priority, and so on.
