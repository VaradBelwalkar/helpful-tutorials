so here is what i understood: programs like "ls" and "nano" are user privilleged commands, 
i.e which user calls them accordingly the processes of those programs will be privlleged hence if any non previlleged user calls nano to 
open a root privilleged file, nano cannot open it as its process doesn't have required permission, but in case of sudo program, 
it is the only program which runs in fully privilleged state even if called by any non-previlleged user, 
so whenever a user calls sudo and passes command that requires root privilleges, as sudo process runs with root privillege, 
it can work with system to find privillege specification and grant or deny user on basis of entries in the sudoers file
