The dnsmasq is a daemon in the linux which is going to listen on the port 53, as run as a dns server, and resolves the domain names to ip addresses.

This dnsmasq gets the domain-name to ip mapping from the /etc/dnsmasq.conf file, and then accordingly gives results

Now, it is clear about dnsmasq.


Now, we move towards the configuring our machines to be able to request to the right dns server

Normally, when you connect your laptop to a private network in your organization, the organization has already the dns server configured and when you 
get the ip address using the DHCP DORA process, you also get dns server info from it.

So, your system simply updates the /etc/resolv.conf file with the ip address of the dns server.

So, whenever your system needs to resolve a domain name, it simply makes dns resolve request to the first dns server listed in the /etc/resolv.conf
file, 
and if it didn't get resolved, it makes to the next available dns server listed in the file, else it fails the resolution of the domain name.

Make sure to update the dnsmasq service whenever you update the /etc/dnsmasq.conf file
