A setuid binary, also known as a set-user-ID binary, is a special type of executable file in Unix-like operating systems that allows the program to be executed with the privileges
of the file owner or a specific user/group, rather than the privileges of the user executing the file. The "uid" in "setuid" refers to the user ID.

When a setuid binary is executed, it temporarily changes the effective user ID (EUID) of the process to that of the owner of the binary. 
This allows the process to perform actions or access resources that are typically restricted to the owner's privileges.
It effectively elevates the privileges of the process, allowing it to carry out tasks that require higher permissions.

Setuid binaries are often used for system administration tasks or other operations that require elevated privileges, 
such as managing network interfaces, modifying system files, or accessing sensitive information. Examples of setuid binaries include 
programs like passwd (used to change passwords) and sudo (used to execute commands with elevated privileges).

Due to the potential security risks associated with setuid binaries, strict security measures are in place to ensure they are used safely. 
This includes careful programming and rigorous testing to prevent unauthorized access or misuse of the elevated privileges. 
Setuid binaries should be reviewed and maintained by system administrators to minimize potential security vulnerabilities.
