With the more command you can actually access the terminal right when you run it!

when in the more, instead of going down, press !

when after that run /bin/bash 

and voila!, you get the terminal access


This i learnt from the bandit overthewire game, where the user's login shell was a more command, so pretty difficult to access the bash,
this command helped me pretty easily


Similarly, when you are using Vim, you can access the terminal by typing :terminal or :term within Vim's command mode.

This opens a terminal window within Vim, allowing you to execute shell commands directly from the editor. 

You can interact with the terminal window, run commands, and view the output while still being in Vim.
