Most oftenly, when installed FreeBSD, you might notice resolution set to 1024*768 or something, and there is no option to change it, 
well, i have solution for AMD cpus, and you might need to follow similar steps for Intel with a bit of googling, 
  so here are those steps:

step 1:
pkg install drm-kmod

step 2:
add all users to video group

step 3: 
configue xorg to work with that driver,
nano /usr/local/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/amd-driver.conf

Section "Device"
    Identifier "Card0"
    Driver     "amdgpu"
    # BusID    "PCI:6:0:0"
EndSection
