Here is the brief information ---->

First of all, you need ot understand that most of the system libraries and functions are shared between processes
So if process A and B, share the same cryptographic algorithm say X, then when this algorithm is in LLC or Last Level Cache,
Both the processes are going to use the same code to execute their own set of values

This is as the actual code is read only and whatever operation needs to be performed, that is carried out by the processes using their values

So, suppose process A is victim and process B is attacker process

Process B would then constantly apply Flush+Reload phases

After the Flush phase, when Process B tries to reload the same lines for the code, if it happens to be a cache miss, means that in that interval,
victim process hasn't used the lines in that code,
but if it happens to be a cache hit, then it means that victim process reloaded those lines as it wanted to execute, 
And in these lines happen to be executed only when there is 1 in the cryptographic value, so attacker would infer from this that there was indeed 1 that is 
present in the key
