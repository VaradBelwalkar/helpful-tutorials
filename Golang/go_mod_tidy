Here the,

                    go mod tidy
                    
command updates the go.mod file according to dependancy changes,

i.e suppose a file was previously using package X from github, and you downloaded that, the go.mod will contain X as dependency,

but when you no longer require the package X in that file and if you remove that package import, still that is listed as dependancy in the go.mod file,

So to update the dependancies, we run the above command, so that the X is REMOVED from the dependancies
