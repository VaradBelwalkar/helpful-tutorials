We flag the cookie as HttpOnly, so that the cookie can only be accessed at the time of request and response, i.e HTTP handling
Means, any javascript code cannot access the cookie (even thee legitimate code of the same website!)
This is useful to prevent Cross Site Scripting that exposes Cookies stored by the browser
