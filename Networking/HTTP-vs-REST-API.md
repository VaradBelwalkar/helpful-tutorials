HTTP API (Application Programming Interface) and REST API (Representational State Transfer API) are terms often used in the context of web development to describe different approaches to building and consuming APIs. While HTTP is a protocol that defines how data is transmitted over the web, REST is an architectural style that uses HTTP as its communication protocol. Let's explore the differences between HTTP API and REST API:

Definition:

HTTP API: This is a broad term that simply refers to any API that uses the HTTP protocol for communication. It doesn't prescribe a specific architectural style or set of constraints.
REST API: REST, on the other hand, is an architectural style that defines a set of constraints and principles to be used when creating web services. RESTful APIs conform to these principles, such as statelessness, resource-based architecture, and a uniform interface.
Architectural Style:

HTTP API: Can follow any architectural style, not necessarily adhering to REST principles. It might be SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol), GraphQL, or some other custom style.
REST API: Adheres to the principles of REST, such as statelessness, resource identification through URIs, uniform interface (using standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), and representation of resources (data) in a standard format like JSON or XML.
Statelessness:

HTTP API: May or may not be stateless. State is managed by the application or the client, and each request from a client contains all the information needed to understand and fulfill the request.
REST API: Emphasizes statelessness. Each request from a client to a server must contain all the information needed to understand and process the request. The server should not store any state about the client between requests.
Uniform Interface:

HTTP API: Does not necessarily enforce a uniform interface. Endpoints and methods can vary between different APIs.
REST API: Enforces a uniform interface, including the use of standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and consistent naming conventions for resources.
Data Format:

HTTP API: Can use various data formats for communication, including XML, JSON, or others.
REST API: Typically uses standard data formats like JSON or XML for representing resources.
Flexibility:

HTTP API: Offers flexibility in terms of design and implementation. It may not adhere strictly to any particular set of principles.
REST API: Provides a more structured and standardized approach to building APIs, promoting a set of principles for better scalability, simplicity, and statelessness.
In summary, while HTTP API is a generic term referring to any API using the HTTP protocol, REST API specifically adheres to the principles of the REST architectural style, providing a standardized and structured approach to web service design.
