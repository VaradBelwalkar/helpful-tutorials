# HTTP API vs REST API

**HTTP API (Application Programming Interface)** and **REST API (Representational State Transfer API)** are terms frequently used in the context of web development to describe different approaches to building and consuming APIs. While HTTP is a protocol that defines how data is transmitted over the web, REST is an architectural style that uses HTTP as its communication protocol. Let's explore the differences between HTTP API and REST API:

## Definitions:

- **HTTP API:**
  - Broad term referring to any API that uses the HTTP protocol for communication.
  - Doesn't prescribe a specific architectural style or set of constraints.

- **REST API:**
  - An architectural style defining a set of constraints and principles for creating web services.
  - RESTful APIs conform to principles like statelessness, resource-based architecture, and a uniform interface.

## Architectural Style:

- **HTTP API:**
  - Can follow any architectural style, not necessarily adhering to REST principles.
  - Examples include SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol), GraphQL, or some other custom style.

- **REST API:**
  - Adheres to REST principles, including statelessness, resource identification through URIs, a uniform interface, and representation of resources in standard formats like JSON or XML.

## Statelessness:

- **HTTP API:**
  - May or may not be stateless.
  - State is managed by the application or the client; each request contains all information needed.

- **REST API:**
  - Emphasizes statelessness.
  - Each request must contain all information needed, and the server should not store any state about the client between requests.

## Uniform Interface:

- **HTTP API:**
  - Does not necessarily enforce a uniform interface; endpoints and methods can vary between different APIs.

- **REST API:**
  - Enforces a uniform interface, using standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and consistent naming conventions for resources.

## Data Format:

- **HTTP API:**
  - Can use various data formats, including XML, JSON, or others, for communication.

- **REST API:**
  - Typically uses standard data formats like JSON or XML for representing resources.

## Flexibility:

- **HTTP API:**
  - Offers flexibility in design and implementation; may not strictly adhere to any particular set of principles.

- **REST API:**
  - Provides a more structured and standardized approach, promoting principles for scalability, simplicity, and statelessness.

In summary, while **HTTP API** is a generic term referring to any API using the HTTP protocol, **REST API** specifically adheres to the principles of the REST architectural style, providing a standardized and structured approach to web service design.
