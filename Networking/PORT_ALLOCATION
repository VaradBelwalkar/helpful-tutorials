Here understand that,
When you create any program or when any chrome tab makes an http request, OS first gives it a random port(from non-famous addresses) 
and then makes the particular request which includes source ip and port given to it as well,
when response comes, it contains those same ip address and port configurations which is used by OS to send the response to particular process

Here, if a service is listening on some port say X, then abviously that port is not given to any request process

And i think that whenever a request is in progress and we try to launch a service on that same port, OS I think might migrate that request to some another
port and make note of it
