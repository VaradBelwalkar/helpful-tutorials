To really workout this well especially on wlans, first turn the network manager service off follow these steps to change mac address successfully:
Here change wlan0 with your appropriate interface i.e may be eth0 in case of ethernet connection

            sudo systemctl stop NetworkManager
            sudo ifconfig wlan0 down
            sudo macchanger -r wlan0             (to set your own:      sudo macchanger --mac xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx wlan0 )
            sudo ifconfig wlano up
            sudo systemctl start NetworkManager
            
Now you can check in your AP's list that the mac address has been changed
