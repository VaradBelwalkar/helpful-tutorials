In React,
It is safe to embed user input in JSX:

const title = response.potentiallyMaliciousInput;
// This is safe:
const element = <h1>{title}</h1>;


By default, React DOM escapes any values embedded in JSX before rendering them. 
Thus it ensures that you can never inject anything thatâ€™s not explicitly written in your application. 
Everything is converted to a string before being rendered. This helps prevent XSS (cross-site-scripting) attacks.

So whatever input is given there in title, it will be converted into STRING thus, browser will render it as string and not actually execute it.
