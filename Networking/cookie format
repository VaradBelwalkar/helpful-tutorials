Here According to Go workflow, 
The cookie is stored in the request or response in the format like 



cookie header ----> {

"cookieName": http.Cookie
"anotherCookie" : http.Cookie
"someAnotherCookie" : http.Cookie

}

So here you can understand that cookie is a header and each entry in that is having a key and value which is of type http.Cookie which contains 
information about the cookie such as name of the cookie(yes, you heard it right, as you can name it anything in the header but in the object, its value is 
there)

So when you get the cookie value like

someCookie,err:= r.Cookie("cookieName")

Then you can access the value of that cookie like

        someCookie.Value
