OSPF stands for Open Shortest Path First protocol

It is an Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) which is used to exchange routing information inside the AS (autonomous system)

Here, the routers inside the autonomous system exchange ther routing information with this OSPF protocol,
But wait, you might be thinking what is the need of such protocol here, why we can't just configure the routers
directly so that they point to the appropriate next hop internal router or to the end device,

The answer is yes, we can indeed configure them manually, but only if your company has few networks configured,
i.e suppose you company has only bought ip network 198.168.2.0/24, which is the minimum offered by the RIR

So here, you would only typically require only one router in your company to connect to the ISP router to be able
to connect to the internet, here, you can easiy configure the router to do subnetting if required using additional
routers and then configure

the default route

to the ISP's router, and tell the ISP to include the entry for this network i.e 198.168.2.0/24, so when the ISP
adds the entry, the BGP protocol running on it will forward the routing information to the neighbour routers and thus
it will reach to the entire internet.


Fine, but suppose,


your company has bought multiple ip networks
```
198.168.4.0/24
198.168.5.0/24
198.168.6.0/24
12.10.0.0/16
145.0.0.0/8
```

here, of course you need to manage the networking on the routers which are actually conncting to the networks, and 
there are other routers which are going to get that information to route the packets to it, and here, you cannot simply 
tell the ISP to update this and this and this, and suppose you add a network afterwards there also you need to tell
ISP to do the updation of the new ip network or ip address, so instead of this, you run the OSPF inside this network
on the routers, and on the company's edge router, you run iBGP to be able to share the routing table information 
with the ISP's router, then the ISP's router is then going to further forward the routing info to other routers and
so on.
