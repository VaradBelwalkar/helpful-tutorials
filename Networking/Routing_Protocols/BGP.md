The BGP protocol is the only EGP i.e Exterior Gateway Protocol available which is used in the core/provider routers to update the routing table with neighbours

The BGP protocol also has two types:

eBGP
iBGP

eBGP is used actually in the external network i.e network of core or provider routers and also containing provider-edge routers, to exchange the routing table

while iBGP is used interally to exchange the information to the provider-edge router i.e mostly the router of the ISP to which our router is connecting to.
