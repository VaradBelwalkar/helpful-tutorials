//Content-Type is one of the headers available in http request

//	Content-Type -------> application/json  

//To pass normal json data 


//Content-Type --------> application/x-www-form-urlencoded

//To recogise on server side that the request is holding form data (data submitted through form)

//Here the data is submitted as a string(obviously)as it is NOT mentioned like this "application/json"
//In a URL-encoded query string, the characters in the string are encoded so that they can be safely transmitted over the Internet. 
//The encoding replaces certain characters with a percent sign followed by a two-digit hexadecimal number. 
//or example, a space is encoded as "%20" and a plus sign is encoded as "%2B".

//For example, consider an HTML form with two text fields, 
//"name" and "email", and a submit button. 
//When the user fills out the form and clicks the submit button, the form data is sent to the server in the body of a POST request. 
//The "Content-Type" header of the request would be set to "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" and the body of the 
//request would look something like this:

//name=John+Doe&email=johndoe%40example.com

//This format is useful because it is simple and easy to parse on the server side.
//However, it has a limitation in that it can only transmit ASCII characters and does not support file uploads. 
//For more advanced functionality, other media types such as "multipart/form-data" or "application/json" may be used instead.
