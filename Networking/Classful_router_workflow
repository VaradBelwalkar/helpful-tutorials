what was happening is that when an organization required range of ip addresses, it would request the internet authority and then internet authority would assign 
the range according to the range, suppose if organization requires only hundreds of ip addresses, the internet authority would give class c address, 
then what it would do is it would manage wiring between nearest router and the oganization's main router and configure the nearest router to pass on the
packets for that particular range suppose 194.2.3.0, and as this information is stored in the routing table, other routers in nearby would gather this information
laterwords through their routing table updation algorithm, and like this all the routers in the world would finally get a path to reach that particular
router which is going to pass the packet to the organization's router, path means all the routers would be able to determine next hop for the packet to transmit to, 
in order for it to reach at given location

The protocols were and still used to update routing table dynamically are Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), 
                                                                          Open Shortest Path First (OSPF),
                                                                          Routing Information Protocol (RIP)
