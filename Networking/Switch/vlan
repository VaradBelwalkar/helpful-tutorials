Vlan as the name says, are virtual LAN network which appears to be LAN but are not exactly,

What do you mean by a LAN, well just a group of computers in the same network typically connected to each other using Switch.
Well yere, all the devices which talk about still reside in the same network as VLAN is NOT a concept about inter-networking but a concept of 
having  manageable cluster of devices through different switches

Consider two switches A and B which are hosting suppose 10-10 devices each, and here, as you know, each device has broadcast domain of 19, 
i.e when a computer broadcasts a packet, it is going to other 19 devices, and if one of the connected computer here is a public computer, 
  it can create unnecessary traffic in the network if it just has to connect to one server in the LAN to get info.

So here, we create VLANs  which are nothing but a group of computers some from first switch and others from another switch, so here, the computers which
are part of this VLAN cannot communicate to the other computers even if they are nearby or connected to the same switch
