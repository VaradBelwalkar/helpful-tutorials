Previously, we’ve explained the concept of a default policy. By default, the default chains have a default policy of accepting all traffic.
This is also something that you can see in the list of rules


You can change the default policy with the -P switch. Perhaps you’re configuring iptables for your home computer, 
and you don’t want any local programs to receive inbound connections.
Once you’ve set iptables to accept packets from related and established connections, you can switch the INPUT chain’s policy to DROP with:


#############################
iptables -P INPUT DROP
#############################

Keep in mind that you should first accept packets from established and related connections before using this rule! 
If you don’t, you’ll find out that you can’t use any internet based applications, 
becuase the responses coming in through the INPUT chain will be dropped.
